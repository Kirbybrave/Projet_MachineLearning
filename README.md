# Projet_MachineLearning
This project predicts Airbnb rental prices using machine learning. It includes data analysis (quality, correlation, reduction), preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Several algorithms are implemented and compared, from regression models to ensemble methods and deep learning, with performance measured using MAE, RMSE, and R².
